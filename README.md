# Pythonized Mouse Clicker
This is basically a mouse clicker on python.
How it works:
 * Calibrate with calibration.bat/.py
 * Follow the instructions
 * Run main.bat/.py

Bat files can be used for automation of this process on Windows. Also, you could make a simple script to run this for n times in an hour, using these two. 

Scripts and functions within them are self explanatory therefore I don't feel the need to comment on them.
